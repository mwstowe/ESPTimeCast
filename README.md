# ESPTimeCast
## Netatmo / Local Sensor 

Some notes:  While this is still a work-in-progress and lacks polish, it is at least functional as of 
29c2f39.  A lot of the code churn is because the tiny device struggles with the complexity of modern API calls and JSON payloads.  It can handle it, in theory, but experience has shown that careful memory management is necessary, and code which prioritizes memory conservation over anything else.

## Recent Changes

### OAuth2 Authentication for Netatmo

The authentication system has been completely redesigned to use OAuth2 instead of username/password. This provides better security and compatibility with Netatmo's API requirements.

### Watchdog Timer Fix

The proxy functionality has been moved to the main loop to avoid watchdog timeouts. This is accomplished by:
1. Setting up a deferred request system where the web server handler only stores the request parameters
2. Processing the actual HTTP requests in the main loop() function
3. Adding yield() calls at critical points to feed the watchdog timer

### Memory Optimization

Several memory optimizations have been implemented to prevent out-of-memory crashes:
1. Improved handling of "NoMemory" errors during configuration validation
2. Disabled file dumping in production to save memory
3. Used fixed-size buffers instead of String objects for response preview
4. Added memory optimization functions for BearSSL clients and HTTPClient instances
5. Added explicit memory cleanup after API calls

While the local temperature sensor works great, I'd recommend putting the probe outside the case where it can get clean readings.  Inside the case, the modest heat from the ESP8266 is enough to make temperature readings suspiciously high and probably pointless.

**ESPTimeCast** is a WiFi-connected LED matrix clock and temperature display based on ESP8266 and MAX7219.  
It displays the current time, day of the week (with custom symbols), indoor temperature from a DS18B20 sensor, and outdoor temperature from a Netatmo weather station.  
Setup and configuration are fully managed via a built-in web interface.

## üìù Configuration Notes

- **Netatmo API Setup:**
  1. Create a Netatmo developer account at [https://dev.netatmo.com/](https://dev.netatmo.com/)
  2. Create a new app to get your Client ID and Client Secret
  3. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret in the ESPTimeCast web interface
  4. Click "Authorize with Netatmo" to start the OAuth2 flow
  5. Log in to your Netatmo account when prompted
  6. Grant the requested permissions (the required scopes are automatically requested)
  7. You'll be redirected back to ESPTimeCast with an authorization code
  8. ESPTimeCast will exchange this code for access and refresh tokens
  9. In your Netatmo developer app settings, add the redirect URI: `http://[device-ip]/api/netatmo/callback`
  10. If you see "request is blocked" errors:
      - Check your app permissions in the Netatmo developer portal
      - Try regenerating your client ID and secret
      - Make sure your Netatmo account has the proper permissions to access the weather station
  11. **Troubleshooting authentication issues**:
      - Visit `http://[device-ip]/netatmo.html` to manage Netatmo settings
      - Check the "Token Status" to verify if authentication is working
      - Use the "Refresh Token" button if the token has expired
      - Verify that your redirect URI is correctly configured in the Netatmo developer portal
- **Device ID and Module IDs:** 
  - After authenticating with Netatmo, ESPTimeCast will automatically fetch your devices
  - Select your weather station and modules from the dropdown menus
  - For outdoor temperature, select the outdoor module
  - For indoor temperature, you can optionally select the base station or another indoor module
- **Temperature Source Options:**
  - **Local sensor primary:** Uses the DS18B20 sensor for indoor temperature, falls back to Netatmo if local sensor fails
  - **Netatmo primary:** Uses Netatmo for indoor temperature, falls back to local sensor if Netatmo fails
- **Time Zone:** Select from IANA zones (e.g., `America/New_York`, handles DST automatically)
- **Units:** `metric` (¬∞C), `imperial` (¬∞F), or `standard` (K)

## üì∫ Display Behavior

**ESPTimeCast** automatically switches between two display modes: Clock and Temperature.  
What you see on the LED matrix depends on whether the device has successfully fetched the current time (via NTP) and temperatures (from DS18B20 and Netatmo).  
The following table summarizes what will appear on the display in each scenario:

| Display Mode | üïí NTP Time | üå°Ô∏è Indoor Temp | üå°Ô∏è Outdoor Temp | üì∫ Display Output                              |
|:------------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|:--------------------------------------------|
| **Clock**    | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚Äî             | ‚Äî              | üóìÔ∏è Day Icon + ‚è∞ Time (e.g. `@ 14:53`)           |
| **Clock**    | ‚ùå No       | ‚Äî             | ‚Äî              |  `no ntp` (NTP sync failed)               |
| **Temp**     | ‚Äî          | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚úÖ Yes         | üè† Indoor + üåç Outdoor (e.g. `23¬∫‚îÇ18¬∫`)      |
| **Temp**     | ‚Äî          | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚ùå No          | üè† Indoor only (e.g. `i 23¬∫C`)              |
| **Temp**     | ‚Äî          | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes         | üåç Outdoor only (e.g. `o 18¬∫C`)            |
| **Temp**     | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚ùå No         | ‚ùå No          | üóìÔ∏è Day Icon + ‚è∞ Time (e.g. `@ 14:53`)           |
| **Temp**     | ‚ùå No       | ‚ùå No         | ‚ùå No          |  `no temp` (no temperature or time data)    |

### **How it works:**

- The display automatically alternates between **Clock** and **Temperature** modes (the duration for each is configurable).
- In **Clock** mode, if NTP time is available, you'll see the current time plus a unique day-of-week icon. If NTP is not available, you'll see `no ntp`.
- In **Temperature** mode, you'll see indoor and/or outdoor temperatures depending on what's available:
  - If both are available, it shows both temperatures separated by a short vertical line (e.g., "23¬∫‚îÇ18¬∫")
  - If only indoor is available, it shows lowercase "i" followed by the temperature (e.g., "i 23¬∫C")
  - If only outdoor is available, it shows lowercase "o" followed by the temperature (e.g., "o 18¬∫C")
  - If neither is available but time is, it falls back to showing the clock
  - If no data is available, you'll see `no temp`
- All status/error messages (`no ntp`, `no temp`) are shown exactly as written.

**Legend:**
- üóìÔ∏è **Day Icon**: Custom symbol for day of week (`@`, `=`, etc.)
- ‚è∞ **Time**: Current time (HH:MM)
- üè† **Indoor**: Temperature from DS18B20 sensor
- üåç **Outdoor**: Temperature from Netatmo weather station
- ‚úÖ **Yes**: Data available
- ‚ùå **No**: Data not available
- ‚Äî : Value does not affect this mode

## üîÑ Modifications

This is a modified version of the original ESPTimeCast project that replaces OpenWeatherMap with:
1. Indoor temperature from a DS18B20 temperature sensor
2. Outdoor temperature from Netatmo weather station

### Changes Made:

1. **Added Libraries**:
   - OneWire and DallasTemperature for DS18B20 sensor
   - ESP8266HTTPClient and WiFiClientSecureBearSSL for Netatmo API

2. **Configuration Changes**:
   - Removed OpenWeatherMap settings (API key, city, country)
   - Added Netatmo API settings (Client ID, Client Secret, Username, Password)
   - Added Netatmo device and module IDs
   - Changed showHumidity to showIndoorTemp and showOutdoorTemp

3. **Hardware Support**:
   - Added DS18B20 temperature sensor on GPIO4 (D2)
   - Kept existing MAX7219 LED Matrix configuration

4. **Display Logic**:
   - Modified to show indoor and outdoor temperatures
   - Added indicators to distinguish between indoor and outdoor readings
   - Maintained compatibility with existing time display

### Troubleshooting:

- If the device shows "no temp" for indoor temperature, check the DS18B20 wiring
- If the device shows "no temp" for outdoor temperature, verify your Netatmo credentials and IDs
- If the time is incorrect, make sure the time zone is properly configured
